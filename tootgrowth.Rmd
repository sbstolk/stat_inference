**Synopsis**
The analysis was conduted on the results of a study comparing tooth length in guinea pigs to the relative dose of Vitamin C. 60 guinea pigs were included in the study.
10 guinea pigs each were randomly assigned to one of 6 groups.  Each group was associated with a dose level of Vitamin C (0.5mg, 1mg and 2 mg) and a delivery method (orange juice or ascorbic acid).
The analysis will indicate if there is any statisticaly significant difference in tooth growth between groups. 

**Analysis**
First, the data was loaded in R. 
```{r}
library(datasets)
data(ToothGrowth)
```
To get an overview of the result, the data was plotted in *ggplot2*. 
```{r}
ggplot(data=ToothGrowth, aes(x=as.factor(dose), y=len, fill=supp)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",)
  facet_grid(. ~ supp)
  xlab("Dose in mg")
  ylab("Tooth length")
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Tooth Growth by Supplement Type"))
```
