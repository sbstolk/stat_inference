**Overview**
#
The goal of this simulation is to compare the sampling of expotential distributions simulated in R with the results predicted by the Central Limit Theorem. 
An exponential distribution is simulated in R using the code rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. For this simuation, lambda is set equal to 0.2.
The distribution of averages of 40 expotentials are examined via 1000 simulatied distributions.
